# CodeEval
These are the solutions to CodeEval's challenges ranking from easy, moderate to hard. In each you will find solutions for specific problems. My goal is to keep adding solutions in different languages for more variety. As for now all of the solutions are written in C#.

Specifically for C# files: When you open up the solution you will notice that some of the files are named _Main. What you would need to do is change the _Main to Main when you want to run that specific console application, but you would also need to change the other Main into _Main in order not to have any conflicts.

This is just a workaround to be able to have all of the files in one solution instead of dedicating a project per solution since most of them are pretty compact.

All of the solutions are in separate folders which also include a sample input file that you can use for testing or fiddling around with it.
